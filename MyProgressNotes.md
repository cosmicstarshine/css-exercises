This is just for me to self-document my notes on what I have learned from completing each of the exercises.
I will include notes on things that make my brain spin and where I will need to spend more time going forward.

Foundations:
    Exercise 1:
        -Fairly straightforward exercise
        -Forgot to organize declarations in alphabetical order (something I was notorious for when I first learned css).
        -Going forward, will maintain alphabetical order to try and keep some structure and avoid getting overwhelmed when CSS starts behaving outside of my intentions.

        -Nothing too spicy here, just some text formatting. For now, I'd say I'm comfortable with all methods of injecting styling.

    Exercise 2:
        -Also fairly straightforward.
        -Selectors don't entirely feel intuitive yet; practice should resolve this.
    
    Exercise 3:
        -Same deal. Fairly simple.
        -Probably could have used more descriptive class-names, but it does the trick.

    Exercise 4:
        -ibid.
    
    Exercise 5:
        -ibid.
    
    Exercise 6:
        -The cascade doesn't seem to be so bad.
        -Specificity is kind of neat, and this was rather vindicating given my history with yelling at CSS.
