This is just for me to self-document my notes on what I have learned from completing each of the exercises.
I will include notes on things that make my brain spin and where I will need to spend more time going forward.

    Exercise 1:
        # Fairly straightforward exercise
        ## Forgot to organize declarations in alphabetical order (something I was notorious for when I first learned css).
